This works using XAMPP (free to download)

putting files in htdocs

starting apache and MySQL on the control panel

accesing the directory of the folder in htdocs

Example....

files in folder called 'swe project'

so go to browser and type localhost/swe project



-------------------------------------

Used MariaDB's version of mySQL.....comes with XAMPP

used phpMYadmin as a GUI for database adminstration......comes with XAMPP
can upload your SQL files directly to it.

to acsess phpMYadmin, just type local host with apache started (control panel), and link is in top right corner

any one stuck? Just ask me in class...
