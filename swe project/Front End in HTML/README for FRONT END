Here are the HTML Files, and a CSS file.

A bootstrap file is also referenced in the HTML, so having this site locally, would still need to have wi-fi to make it look neat.

It can function without internet, but will look kinda ugly.

In short, there is nothing high-end or fancy used for the front-end.
