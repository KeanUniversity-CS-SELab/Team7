Ran with windows task scheduler, and needed a batch file to make a call to the files in this folder.

As mentioned in the main README, on the Team 7 home page, apache and MySQL need to be on for this work.

Obviously, Internet will need to be working as well.

The batch file I used is two lines, and included in this folder.....useful for those using XAMPP. 
One would just need to place their own pathname into. Explained, and some useful links provided
in main README on Team 7 homepage.
