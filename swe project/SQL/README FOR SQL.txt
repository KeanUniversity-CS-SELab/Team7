The SQL files here, have 5 years of data for google and apple

For RFEM, they contain about 3, I believe.

The files go up October 24, 2019. Because that is when I made the 5 year calls for each of the 3 companies.

After October 24, 2019, The sql files were updated on MariaDB & myPHPadmin.

This was done using two PHP files, acting as scripts.

Thanks!
