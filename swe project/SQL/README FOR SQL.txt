The SQL files here, have 5 years of data for google and apple

For RFEM, they only go back to around June 15, 2016.

The SQL files are most recent up to October 24, 2019. Because that is when I made the 5 year calls for each of the 3 companies.

After October 24, 2019, The sql files were updated on MariaDB & myPHPadmin.

This was done using two PHP files, acting as scripts. Also, windows task scheduluer was used.

If anyone has questions, feel free to talk to me in class, or emai..
